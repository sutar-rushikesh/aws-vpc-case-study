# AWS VPC Case Study – Public & Private Subnet Architecture

## 📌 Case Study Overview

An organization is planning to deploy its **UAT environment** on AWS.
The requirement is to design a **secure and scalable VPC architecture** where:

- Internet-facing resources are deployed in a **Public Subnet**
- Application servers are deployed in a **Private Subnet**
- Private servers must not be directly accessible from the internet
- Private servers should access the internet using a **NAT Gateway**

You are assigned as a **Cloud / DevOps Engineer** to design and implement this architecture from scratch.
